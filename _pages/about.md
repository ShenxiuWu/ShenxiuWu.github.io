Greetings! I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Guohao Lan](https://guohao.netlify.app/) and [Prof. Qun Song](https://song-qun.github.io/) in the [Embedded Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems) of the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), the Netherlands. My research interests are in the intersection of edge computing, AI Internet of Things (IoT), and TinyML across various domains, intending to build intelligent and resource-efficient edge AI-enhanced mobile systems.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
